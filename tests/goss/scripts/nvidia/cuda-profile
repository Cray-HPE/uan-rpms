export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.0/bin:/usr/local/cuda-11.0/NsightCompute-2019.1${PATH:+:${PATH}}
####In addition, when using the runfile installation method, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable needs to contain /usr/local/cuda-11.0/lib64 on a 64-bit system, or /usr/local/cuda-11.0/lib on a 32-bit system
####
####To change the environment variables for 64-bit operating systems:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

####To change the environment variables for 32-bit operating systems:

####export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.0/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
